I have received bachelor degree majoring in **Optoelectronic Information Science and Engineering** at North University of China in 2017, and master degree majoring in **Electronic and Communication Engineering** at Beijing University of Aeronaut and Astronaut in 2020. Since Jun. 2020 I have been a research assistant at Beijing University of Aeronaut and Astronaut Yunnan Innovation Institute and my current research lies in **antenna and array design**, **active metasurfaces** and **radar cross section analysis and control**. Here is [my Resume](https://HangyuChen.github.io/file/resume-hangyuchen.pdf). 


**Now, I am looking for a PhD position starting in 2024 to continue research in relevant fields**. Furthermore, some of my key information is listed below to give you a basic description of me. Sincerely, I am glad to tell you more about me and what motivates me to pursue PhD in my personal statement by [clicking here]( https://hangyuchen.github.io/personalstatement/).

## Research Interests

- Antenna and Array Design
- Active Metasurfaces
- Electromagnetic (EM) Waves

Basically, my current research can be classified into radiation and scattering, mainly including antenna and array design, active metasurfaces and radar cross section control. For radiation, some kinds of antennas and phased arrays with specific requirements have been investigated. For scattering, active metasurfaces and their radar cross section control have taken up most of my research in relation to scattering. Of course, welcome to review my work by [clicking here](https://hangyuchen.github.io/research&outputs/), and leave your precious feedback on my research!
