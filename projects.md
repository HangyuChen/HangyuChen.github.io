## Intelligent Bicycle System with Automatic Shift and Anti-theft

This project we applied for was selected as ‘National College Students Innovation and Entrepreneurship Project’ (**Rank: 3rd out of total 245**) when I was sophomore in 2015. Finally, project was accomplished on time and received recognition and 10000 yuan as the financial support from China Ministry of Education. As the team leader, my contributions are listed below:

- Learn and debug the communication between the STM32 MCU and acceleration sensor, gyroscope sensor MPU6050, GSM+GPS system SIM808, and orthogonal encoder. 
- Merge data from sensors and update AHRS information of bicycle as the trigger of alarm.
- Extract location information and send an alarming message to the owner of bicycle via the communication with SIM808 in ‘AT’ commands.
- Capture the trigger from both Hall sensors and orthogonal encoder then calculate the speed accurately to provide speed information and alter to low or high gear.

<br>This task was listed in 2015 National Undergraduate Electronic Design Contest our team participated in and we selected it as our goal to achieve. All of teammates worked together and accomplished together most of requirements of this task. Finally, we won the second prize! As the team leader, I was assigned to complete the following missions:

- Learn STM32 and debug the communication interfaces between MCU and acceleration sensor, and gyroscope sensor MPU6050. Then extract the real time attitude data from MPU6050 Digital Motion Processor.
- Assist my teammate, who was in charge of algorithm, to build up the control flow based on raw attitude data from sensor to control the fan.

<br>This project was designed for the need of our Signal Processing Laborotary to detect the objects in the air by using of video and I was assigned to complete the design of quadcopter and finished the following tasks:

- Design the flight control board PCB by Altium Designer and assemble mechanical and electronic parts.
- Study the theory of quadcopter and debug communication between master STM32F103RBT6 MCU and acceleration sensor, gyroscope sensor MPU6050, geomagnetic sensor HMC5883L, 2.4 GHz wireless module nRF2401 and barometer MS5611.
- Build up PID algorithm to control the quadcopter in AHRS information calculated via electric sensors.

## Grocery Cashier System
<img src="/images/grocery.png" >
To support the small grocery of my parents and reduce cost for family, a mini cashier desk application driven by lightweight database MySQL was devised and is still in used at present.

- Learn E language grammar and basic SQL commands.
- Construct the basic application frame on screen and logic of the whole system including processing the input information, adding or deleting the commodity information and etc.
- Debug the interaction between application and database via SQL commands in E language.
