## Intelligent Bicycle System with Automatic Shift and Anti-theft

This project we applied for was selected as ‘National College Students Innovation and Entrepreneurship Project’ (**Rank: 3rd out of total 245**) when I was sophomore in 2015. Finally, project was accomplished on time and received recognition and 10000 yuan as the financial support from China Ministry of Education. As the team leader, my contributions are listed below:

- Learn and debug the communication between the STM32 MCU and acceleration sensor, gyroscope sensor MPU6050, GSM+GPS system SIM808, and orthogonal encoder. 
- Merge data from sensors and update AHRS information of bicycle as the trigger of alarm.
- Extract location information and send an alarming message to the owner of bicycle via the communication with SIM808 in ‘AT’ commands.
- Capture the trigger from both Hall sensors and orthogonal encoder then calculate the speed accurately to provide speed information and alter to low or high gear.

<br>This project was designed for the need of our Signal Processing Laborotary to detect the objects in the air by using of video and I was assigned to complete the design of quadcopter and finished the following tasks:

- Design the flight control board PCB by Altium Designer and assemble mechanical and electronic parts.
- Study the theory of quadcopter and debug communication between master STM32F103RBT6 MCU and acceleration sensor, gyroscope sensor MPU6050, geomagnetic sensor HMC5883L, 2.4 GHz wireless module nRF2401 and barometer MS5611.
- Build up PID algorithm to control the quadcopter in AHRS information calculated via electric sensors.
